TODO:

- Remove unused code
-- metric 6 is not used anymore

- Find a set of preprocessing options and delete the remaining code

- Separate in different files

- Move more functions to classes

- Port to java :(( We will have to deal with some C-specific commands like unsigned integers, operations on pointers, etc.
